  |          ^^^^^^^^^ function was supposed to return data with lifetime `'__long` but it is returning data with lifetime `'a`

  = help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: '__long`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Transient` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
