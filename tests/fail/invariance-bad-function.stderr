   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: 'b`
   = note: requirement occurs because of the type `transient::Inv<'_>`, which makes the generic argument `'_` invariant
   = note: the struct `transient::Inv<'a>` is invariant over the parameter `'a`
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
