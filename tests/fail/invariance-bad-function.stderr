error: lifetime may not live long enough

  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function was supposed to return data with lifetime `'b` but it is returning data with lifetime `'a`

  = help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: 'b`
  = note: requirement occurs because of the type `transient::Inv<'_>`, which makes the generic argument `'_` invariant
  = note: the struct `transient::Inv<'a>` is invariant over the parameter `'a`
  = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
